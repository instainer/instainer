#What is instainer?

Instainer is a Docker container hosting service which allows run instantly any Docker container on the cloud with Heroku-style Git deployment.

We believe in [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). When we started migration to Docker in our company, we felt that something was still missing. Docker brought amazing capabilities to our DevOps team, but still there wasn't any service to click and run any Docker containers instantly. We are doers. We developed Instainer for engineers who want to run Docker containers on the cloud instantly. Your feedbacks & thoughts are really welcome. Thanks in advance!


#Quick Start
####Open [beta.instainer.com](http://beta.instainer.com), click any container to run.
